CREATE CYTOSCAPE WEBSTART
-------------------------

1) Run cytoscape webstart ant task:

- update bulid.xml and replace all storepass attributes with your storepass 
- update bulid.xml and replace all alias attributes with your alias
- make sure code signing keystore file, .keystore is located in your home directory
- type: "ant -DwebstartURL=http://yourdomain.com webstart" on commandline inside cytoscape dir

2) Move signed cytoscape files into cpath tree:

- move files in build/webstart to $CPATH_ROOT/web/jsp/cytoscape
- modify .props files as needed
- verify that $CPATH_ROOT/src/org/mskcc/pathdb/servlet/CytoscapeJnlpServlet.java, writeJNLPData() references all required jars
  (this can be done by comparing servlet with $CPATH_ROOT/web/jsp/cytoscape/cy1.jnlp

3) Done!
