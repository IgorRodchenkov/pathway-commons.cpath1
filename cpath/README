CREATE CYTOSCAPE WEBSTART
-------------------------

1) Run cytoscape webstart ant task:

- update build.xml and replace all storepass attributes with your storepass (see Ben for password)
- update build.xml and replace all alias attributes with your alias (alias="cbio")
- make sure code signing keystore file, .keystore is located in your home directory
- type: "ant -DwebstartURL=http://yourdomain.com webstart" on commandline inside cytoscape dir
  example:  ant -DwebstartURL=http://cerami.bscb.cornell.edu/ webstart
  example:  ant -DwebstartURL=http://192.168.0.4/ webstart

2) Move signed cytoscape files into cpath tree:

- move files in build/webstart to $CPATH_ROOT/web/jsp/cytoscape
- restore the original cytoscape.props file in $CPATH_ROOT/web/jsp/cytoscape (if you just clobbered it), and modify as needed
- verify that $CPATH_ROOT/src/org/mskcc/pathdb/servlet/CytoscapeJnlpServlet.java, writeJNLPData() references all required jars
  (this can be done by comparing servlet with $CPATH_ROOT/web/jsp/cytoscape/cy1.jnlp

3) Done!
