<h1>About Pathway Commons</h1>
<p>Pathway Commons is a convenient point of access to biological pathway information
collected from public pathway databases, which you can browse or search.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Biologists</b> can browse and search Pathway Commons pathways.</li>
    <li><b>Computational biologists</b> can download all pathways in BioPAX format for global analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Software developers</b> can build software on top of Pathway Commons using
        our soon-to-be released web service API. Download and install the cPath pathway database software to create a local mirror of Pathway Commons.

<h1>About cBio @ MSKCC</h1>
<p>The Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(<a href="http://www.mskcc.org">MSKCC</a>) pursues computational biology research projects
and the development of bioinformatics resources in the areas of:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> sequence-structure analysis </li>
   <li> gene regulation </li>
   <li> molecular pathways and networks </li>
   <li> diagnostic and prognostic indicators </li>
</ul>
<p>
The mission of cBio is to move the theoretical methods and genome-scale data resources of
computational biology into everyday laboratory practice and use, and is reflected in the
organization of cBio into research and service components &#126; the intention being that
new computational methods created through the process of scientific inquiry should be
generalized and supported as open-source and shared community resources.
