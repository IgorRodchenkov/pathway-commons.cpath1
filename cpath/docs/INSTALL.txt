This document describes the procedure for installing cPath.

System Requirements:
--------------------
To install cPath, you must have the following installed locally:

1.  mySQL:  Information available at:  http://www.mysql.com/.
2.  Apache Tomcat Server, 4.1X or above:  
	Information available at:  http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/
	Note that cPath has not been tested on Apache Tomcat, 5.X or above.
3.  Apache Ant:  Information available at:  http://ant.apache.org/

Step-by-Step Instructions:
--------------------------

1.  If you have not already done so, install mySQL, Apache Tomcat, and Ant locally.
Once you have verified that the installations are working correctly, proceed to step 2.

2.  Create a mysql user for cPath.  For easiest installation, use the following:

	user:  		tomcat
	password:	kitty

If you choose a different user/password combination, see Appendix A below.

Instructions on adding new mySQL users is available online at: 
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Adding_users.html

3.  Load the cPath Tables.  To do so:

cd [CPATH_ROOT]/dbData
mysql -u tomcat -p < cpath.sql

You will be prompted for a password.  Enter the value:  "kitty".

4.  Load a Demo Set of Sample data

cd [CPATH_ROOT]/dbData
mysql -u tomcat -p < demo.sql

You will again be prompted for a password.  Enter the value:  "kitty".

5.  Create the Web Application Archive for cPath.

cd [CPATH_ROOT]
ant war

In the [CPATH_ROOT]/dist directory, you will now find cpath.war

6.  Copy cpath.war to [JAKARTA_TOMCAT_DIR]/webapps and restart Apache Tomcat.

7.  Open a web browser, and go to:  http://localhost:8080/cpath

Verify that you can see the cPath Home Page.

8.  As a final step, you must run the full text indexer.

a.  Go to:  http://localhost:8080/cpath/adminHome.do
b.  Select the link:  "Run Full Text Indexer" -- full indexing of the demo set
takes approximately 30 seconds.

Appendix A:  Creating a CPath MySQL User
----------------------------------------

If you choose a mySQL user other than user=tomcat/password=kitty, you must
update two configuration files:

[CPATH_ROOT]/config/config-JDBC.properties;  and
[CPATH_ROOT]/web/WEB-INF/web.xml

Replace the words tomcat/kitty with your own username/password.
