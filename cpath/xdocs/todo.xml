This document contains cPath Items we want to implement someday:

cPath Functionality Issues:
----------------------------
1.  We still don't have any way of adding new external databases,
    and the controlled vocabulary terms and URLs associated with each database.
    As a first step, we should definitely add a command line script to
    do this.
    --->  current priority:  I think this is relatively high.

2.  Import Complete Data Set

    From Gary:  DIP, MINT and IntAct now all have downloadable full data
    sets.  We should think about creating an official inhouse release of cpath
    containing all of the data we can get (since the DIP data is proprietary, we
    can't give it to anyone else externally).

    [Status:  We now have DIP, MINT and Intact. We still need to import HPRD.]

3.  Modify Cytoscape PlugIn to recognize n-ary interactions when n > 2.
	-->  current priority:  high

    [Status:  This functionality is working, but it still needs more testing.]

4.  Use IntAct External Database File

    From Gary:  "I just noticed that the IntAct database is maintaining a small
    file of external databases
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/intact/intactCore/data/
    controlledVocab/CvDatabase.def?rev=1.7&amp;view=auto

    We might be able to eventually collaborate with them on this list.
    Something to just keep in mind."

6.  Build a Front-end administrative interface to the External Database Tables
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.

7.  Provide query API functionality to get a list of valid query API commands.
	E.g. for getInteractionsBySource, we could have getValidSources
	---> current priority:  low.

8.  Add getExternalReferences to query API.  This would allow e.g. Cytoscape
	to easily create external links.
	---> current priority:  medium.

9.  Support content-length calculation of PSI-MI queries, where possible,
    to support more accurate progress metering on the client side.  We might
    be able to easily do it for queries that are cached and for the precomputed
    queries.  For queries that aren't, we could at least provide
    updates of the parsing progress as it happens (Rob's idea)
	---> Current priority: low.

11.  Resolve cross-species interaction issue.

12. Implement a full database/ web  statistics page.
    This could be precomputed regularly (e.g. weekly), not computed on the
    fly.  The best example of a stats page is currently the MINT page:
    http://160.80.34.4/mint/statistics/statistics.php
	---> Current priority: low.

13.  Create an advanced query system for xml records that supports xquery or
     something similar. This could regularly index XML from cpath for advanced
     queries.  Only internal users would use this system and it would probably
     be slow.  Investigate databases that support xpath or libraries such as OJB.

14.  Add generic support for an ontology data objects.

    From Gary:  "As per our discussion today regarding PSI-MI controlled
    vocabularies, here is an implementation of a basic hierarchy from the
    GK project.

    Example 1:
    http://www.genomeknowledge.org/cgi-bin/classbrowser?DB=gk_current

    Example 2:
    http://www.genomeknowledge.org/cgi-bin/eventbrowser?DB=gk_current&amp;
    ID=69231&amp;PREVIOUS_ID=69236&amp;RORDER=69278&amp;E=69236&amp;E=69278

    (mind the wrapping)

    I'm not saying that we should implement this scheme eventually, we should
    just note the example.

15. Front end features (May31.2004):
-Save search options in a cookie
-Database stats page - expand and for the current contents, link to the DBODBs
 for the database + the database itself.

16. We need to be able to present Non-redundant interactions - all interactions
should be non-redundant. (May31.2004)

17. Create a post-process for non-redundant interactors - once larger lists of
 xrefs are in cPath, process can optimize the interactors to find ones that
 overlap in xref space and put them together. (May31.2004)

18.  Add support for incremental indexing.
I think this would require a timestamp for each cPath record,
so that we could easily determine the date/time the record was last
indexed in Lucene.  (June3.2004)

19.  Address Interactor/External Reference Identity Issue.
Right now, we use external references to uniquely identify proteins.
However, while loading all of IntAct, I noticed that most interactors
include references which are not unique to the protein.  For example, IntAct
includes GO/InterPro references, which are not unique to the protein.

As a temporary work-around, I currently filter out GO/InterPro
references when looking for a match, but I think we should brainstorm
about some better, more generic options going forward.

20.  "My favorite gene list" - This would let you select genes that
cPath knows about and create a nice table for you.  E.g. all the cancer genes.
	---> Current priority: low.

21. Cache: include count of numer of times a request has been made and use this
to prioritize the purging of the cache.  This will help keep often viewed pages
in the cache. Possible prioritization: purge oldest and least viewed documents
	---> Current priority: low.

22.  Set up auto-emails upon fatal cPath errors
    (how does a user deal with errors?).

23.  Revisit the Advanced Search Functionality. (June.18.2004)
Chris found the Advanced Search filters very confusing.  His main complaint
is that the two pull-downs are logically inconsistent.  For example, when using
the organism pull-down menu, you are selecting from a list of values.  When
using the filter pull-down menu, you are selecting from a list of fields --
you then need to add a value for that field in the search box.

Chris also found the filter types confusing.  For example, when looking at
the experiment type filter, he had no idea what a good search value would be
here.  Same goes for database source.  Perhaps we could add pull-down menus
with values for each of these filters.

I am not sure the answer to any of these issues, but we should think about it
more in the next phase.

24.  Make cPath Data available via FTP (June18.2004)
This was suggested by Alex at the cPath Information session.

25.  Add Link to PDB (June18.2004)
Boris suggested that we add links to PDB in the protein view.

26.  Create Auto-updater (June18.2004)
Mike suggested we create some kind of tool for automatically updating
cPath with data from DIP, MINT, etc.  This would probably be fairly involved.

27.  Deal with Redundant cPath Data (July16.2004)
One instance of this issue:

The protein view can sometimes show the same protein in multiple rows.
This view should avoid duplicated information in the rows at the bottom of the
screen for the precedence order 'interactor' then 'experimental evidence'.

For example, try searching cpath on cbio for:  interactor_id:55

28. Batch or list queries. It makes sense to be able to submit a list of things
to some queries e.g.  Give me all the interactions for this list of protein IDs.
This could be used for a custom pathway definition if people know all of the
 proteins in a pathway

29. Make cPath easier to install by optionally packaging data with it.
 Specifically:
-All publicly available interactions
-All ID tables

30.  Add HTTP Proxy Support
(like that provided in Web Browsers)
Request by:  Ioannis.Xenarios@serono.com

31. When importing PSI-MI files, if the xref database name is not known to
cPath, then maybe the user should be asked for it during the import process.
One possible implementation - if PSI-MI import fails because of a database name
mapping issue, then save the import file, ask the user to fill in the details
of the database and use the saved PSI-MI file to try the import again.
 (Sep.13.2004)

32. Some databases, like HPRD and IntAct, put xrefs in proteins that are
not 1:1 with proteins.  E.g. HPRD adds pubmed papers and IntAct adds GO
annotation.  These might be used for protein xref lookup. There should be a
list of ID types that should not be used for xref lookup for proteins.
Maybe another field to add to the external ref DB. (Sep.13.2004)

33.  Refactor pipeline for importing PSI-MI data to to check all those things
which are not enforced by the PSI-MI XML Schema.  Here's how data import should
really work:

a.  XML Schema Validation
b.  Semantic Validation:  checks things in PSI-MI that are not specified by the
    Schema.
c.  Data Integrity Validation:  checks things in PSI-MI with cross checks
    against existing data in cPath.
d.  Only if all three tests pass should we add to the import table.  And, once
    something is in import, we chop it up into interactors/interactions, etc.

We also need to reconsider whether we want to allow importing of data files
from the Admin web front end, and if we do, how we report all errors/warnings
to the end user.

Data Service Specific Items:
-----------------------------
1.  Add Gene Name/Synonym Look up to data services (requires a back-end, may
    be able to use Entrez Gene DB).

2.  Create a service for reading in Cytoscape node/edge attributes to go with
    sif reader.

3.  Create an "About Data Services PlugIn", with version #, list of all
    registered (more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.

4.  Resurrect the GRID Plugin - retrieves data from GRID directly into Cytoscape

cPath Cytoscape Plugin Functionality Issues:
--------------------------------------------
1.  We should have hyperlinks from the accession numbers displayed on the
interactor and interaction details window to the various databases, taxonomy
information to the NCBI taxonomy database and from any PSI CV terms to a term
definition DB (like QuickGO).  We should extend the web service to provide these
links (this could be a really! popular web service!!!)  - We could just include
it as attributes in the PSI-MI file in the meantime as an alternative if we want.
This might be faster than polling a web service.

2.  From Niki: We should list the chip type as part of the Affymetrix identifier
information

3.  Ability to select multiple nodes and edges and see all the information in
 an Excel type table (later, allow users to select which columns of data are
 available) - maybe this will be better done by the attribute browser.

4. Ability to specify chunk size for chunked downloads in preferences
(up to a point to protect the web service).


Archive:  Items which are now complete:
--------------------------------------------------
1.  Add Field Specific Lucene Searching, e.g. "name:RAS".
    ---> current priority:  low.
    [Status:  NOW COMPLETE]

2.  Add new query:  query by experimental method (e.g. all the data from
    two-hybrid)
	---> current priority:  hi.
    [Status:  NOW COMPLETE]

3.  Add Indexing of interactions.
    Requires changes to web interface.  Needs more exploration.
    ---> current priority:  low.
    [Status:  NOW COMPLETE]

4.  For HTML front end of cPath query API: pageinate results
    (only text index results currently paginated)
	---> current priority:  low.
    [Status:  NOW COMPLETE]

5. Add support to cPath and data services layer for importing PSI-MI files
    that contain interactions with more than two proteins (e.g. 5 protein complex).
    This would allow us to import data from the PIN database in the Tempst lab
    at MSKCC  (http://pin.mskcc.org).

    [Status:  NOW COMPLETE]
