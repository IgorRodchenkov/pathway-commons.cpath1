<UL>
    <LI>Second iteration of support for BioPAX data.
        <UL>
            <LI>Before saving a new BioPAX pathway, interaction, or
            physical entity, cPath now makes sure that the entity is not
            already stored.  Identity is currently determined via
            Unification XRefs.
            </LI>
            <LI>Upon import of new BioPAX entities, cPath now queries the
            Background Reference subsystem, so that other identifiers, such
            as Affymetrix IDs are added automatically appended.
            </LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>Modifications to the Web Services API:
        <UL>
            <LI>New command:  get_top_level_pathway_list.  Retrieves a
            complete list of top-level pathways store in cPath.  A top-level
            pathway is defined as a pathway that contains other
            pathways.  For example, the Reactome Apoptosis pathway
            contains several other pathways, such
            as:  Extrinsic Pathway for Apoptosis, Intrinsic Pathway for
            Apoptosis, etc.  The response to this command is a BioPAX
            XML document.
            </LI>
            <LI>New command:  get_record_by_cpath_id.  Retrieves a BioPAX
            document from cPath.  The response to this command is a BioPAX
            XML document.
            </LI>
            <LI>Note that neither of these commands is documented
            on the Web Service API Help Page.  We did this because we
            needed these new commands ASAP, but did not want to spend
            the time to revisit the web service API in its entirety.
            In a later phase, we place to revisit the API, and these
            commands may change.</LI>
