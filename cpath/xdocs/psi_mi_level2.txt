Extending cPath to PSI-MI, Level 2
==================================

cPath currently supports PSI-MI Level 1.  This document outlines steps
necessary to support PSI-MI Level 2.  All time values are rough estimates,
and include time to write unit tests.

Total Time Estimate:  24 business days.

Changes to core Data Services Code:
-----------------------------------
1.  Generate Java code for PSI-MI Level 2 via Castor
2.  Modify the package structure so that data services clearly supports level
1 and 2.

Time Estimate:  2 days.

Design Changes:
---------------
Major issue is how we simultaneously store/process PSI-MI levels 1 and 2, and
store additional future formats, such as BioPAX.  The two major options are:

Option 1:  We store multiple formats in cPath at the same time.  Each snippet
 of XML gets tagged with format value, e.g. PSI_MI_LEVEL_1 or BIO_PAX_LEVEL_1.
 Upon exporting of data for presentation on web site or distribution via web
 service, we transform all snippets into a common format.

Option 2:  We transform all snippets upon import into one common data format.
Upon exporting of data for presentation on web site or distribution via web
service, we simply "copy and paste" all the snippets together.

This requires more extensive analysis and conversations between Ethan, Gary
and Iain.  I think option 1 makes the most sense, but worry about the
performance hit on the web site and the web service.

Time Estimate:  3 days

Changes to core cPath Code
--------------------------
1.  Regardless of which option we choose above, we will need one set of
transformers.  For example, we will need a transformer that converts Level 1
to Level 2, or we need a transformer that assembles snippets of Level 1 and
Level 2 and normalizes to a chosen level.

Time Estimate:  5 days

2. Database changes (minimal)

Time Estimate:  1 day

3.  Modify the Import Pipeline to support Levels 1 and 2

Most of the work here is included in point 1, but we need to include lots
of unit tests to ensure that it all works.

Time Estimate:  3 days

4.  Modify Full Text Indexer

Hopefully, only minimal changes

Time Estimate:  2 days

5.  Modify Web Front End

Most of this work is to present new data in Level 2 and make it look good.
This may require design changes, and a few design reviews.

Time Estimate:  5 days

6.  Modify Web Service

Modify format parameter, so that clients can choose level 1 or level 2.

Again, most of this work is in point 1 above.

Time Estimate:  3 days
