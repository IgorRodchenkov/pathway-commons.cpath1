    <section name="About cPath">
        <p>
        cPath aims to be a freely available cancer pathway database. Currently, only
        information about protein-protein interactions collected from major
        interaction databases that support the PSI-MI format is available. cPath is
        open-source and is easy to locally install for private management of
        protein-protein interactions. Future directions include support for the
        <a href="http://biopax.org">BioPAX format</a> so that entire pathways can be
        stored, queried and presented.
        </p>
        <p>
        cPath is currently being developed by the
            <A HREF="http://cbio.mskcc.org">Computational Biology Center</A>
            of <A HREF="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan-Kettering
            Cancer Center.</A>

    <p>
    The goal of this site is to provide timely information for cPath developers.
    The site is automatically updated every 24 hours, and provides a snapshot
    of all publicly available development work, currently checked into CVS.  Here, you can browse
    the latest JavaDocs, source code, and automatically generated reports.
    You can also browse the latest release notes, installation instructions,
    and technical architecture documents.
