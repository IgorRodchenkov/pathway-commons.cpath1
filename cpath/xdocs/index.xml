        <p>
        cPath is a freely available cancer pathway database.
        We are building this as a resource to the community.
        Currently, basic protein-protein interaction functionality
        is available. We expect to make a preliminary version of
        cPath available to the public in early 2004. In the near
        future, we also plan to make cPath BioPax compatibile.
        </p>
        <p>
        cPath is currently being developed by the
            <A HREF="http://cbio.mskcc.org">Computational Biology Center</A>
            of <A HREF="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan-Kettering
            Cancer Center.</A>

    <section name="About the Developer Site">
    <p>
    The goal of this site is to provide timely information for cPath developers.
    The site is automatically updated every 24 hours, and provides a snapshot
    of all development work, currently checked into CVS.  Here, you can browse
    the latest JavaDocs, Source Code, and automatically generated reports.
    You can also browse the latest release notes, installation instructions,
    and technical architecture documents.
