      <p>
          cPath currently uses an iterative development cycle for developing
          new features.  At the beginning of each phase, we document
          a list of new features, and flesh out the functional
          requirements for each new feature.  We also provide technical
          details on how to intend to implement each new feature.
      </p>
      <p>
          The documents below contain information for each
          phase of cPath development so far.

                Module.  The Data Services Module is a standalone library used

                data from a diverse set of data sources.</td>

                The web service API was originally created to access a mirror
                of the GRID database, and has since been integrated into
                the core cPath code.
