This document contains cPath/Cytoscape Items we want to implement someday:

cPath Functionality Issues:
----------------------------
1.  Field Specific Searching, e.g. "name:RAS". 
	---> current priority:  low.
2.  Indexing of interactions.
	Requires changes to web interface.  Needs more exploration.
	---> current priority:  low.
3.  Build a Front-end interface to the External Database Tables
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
4.  Add new query:  query by experimental method (e.g. all the data from two-hybrid)
	---> current priority:  ???.
5.  Provide query API functionality to get a list of valid query API commands.  
	E.g. for getInteractionsBySource, we could have getValidSources
	---> current priority:  low.
6.  Add getExternalReferences to query API.  This would allow e.g. Cytoscape 
	to easily create external links.
	---> current priority:  medium.
7.  For HTML front end of cPath query API: paginate results
	---> current priority:  low.

cPath Performance/Reliability/Security Issues
---------------------------------------------
1.  Prevent against cross-scripting vulnerability.
2.  Set up auto-emails upon fatal cPath errors.

Data Service Specific Items:
-----------------------------
1.  Add an Ontology object to the dataservices bio package.
2.  Add Gene Name/Synonym Look up to data services.
3.  Create a service for reading in Cytoscape node/edge attributes.
4.  Create an "About Data Services PlugIn", with version #, list of all registered
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
5.  Resurrect the GRID Plugin
