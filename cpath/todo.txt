This document contains cPath/Cytoscape Items we want to implement someday:

cPath Functionality Issues:
----------------------------
1.  Field Specific Lucene Searching, e.g. "name:RAS". 
	---> current priority:  low.
2.  Indexing of interactions.
	Requires changes to web interface.  Needs more exploration.
	---> current priority:  low.
3.  Build a Front-end administrative interface to the External Database Tables
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
4.  Add new query:  query by experimental method (e.g. all the data from two-hybrid)
	---> current priority:  ???.
5.  Provide query API functionality to get a list of valid query API commands.  
	E.g. for getInteractionsBySource, we could have getValidSources
	---> current priority:  low.
6.  Add getExternalReferences to query API.  This would allow e.g. Cytoscape 
	to easily create external links.
	---> current priority:  medium.
7.  For HTML front end of cPath query API: paginate results (only text index results currently 
    paginated)
	---> current priority:  low.
8.  Support content-length calculation of PSI-MI queries, where possible, to support more accurate 
    progress metering on the client side.  We might be able to easily do it for queries that are 
    cached and for the precomputed queries.  For queries that aren't, we could at least provide 
    updates of the parsing progress as it happens (Rob's idea)
	---> Current priority: low.
9.  Resolve cross-species interaction issue.
10. Implement a full statistics page.  This could be precomputed regularly (e.g. weekly),
    not computed on the fly.  The best example of a stats page is currently the MINT page:
    http://160.80.34.4/mint/statistics/statistics.php
	---> Current priority: low.
11. Add support to cPath and data services layer for importing PSI-MI files that contain 
    interactions with more than two proteins (e.g. 5 protein complex).  This would allow us to 
    import data from the PIN database in the Tempst lab at MSKCC (http://pin.mskcc.org).
	---> Current priority: medium.
12.  From Gary:  DIP, MINT and IntAct now all have downloadable full data
sets.  We should think about creating an official inhouse release of cpath
containing all of the data we can get (since the DIP data is proprietary, we
can't give it to anyone else externally). 

cPath Performance/Reliability/Security Issues
---------------------------------------------
1.  Prevent against cross-scripting vulnerability (validate user input before use).
2.  Set up auto-emails upon fatal cPath errors (how does a user deal with errors?).

Data Service Specific Items:
-----------------------------
1.  Add an Ontology object to the dataservices bio package to allow retrieval of Gene Ontology type 
    information.
2.  Add Gene Name/Synonym Look up to data services (requires a back-end, may be able to use Entrez 
    Gene DB).
3.  Create a service for reading in Cytoscape node/edge attributes to go with sif reader.
4.  Create an "About Data Services PlugIn", with version #, list of all registered
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
5.  Resurrect the GRID Plugin - retrieves data from GRID directly into Cytoscape
