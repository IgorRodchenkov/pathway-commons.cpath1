This document contains cPath/Cytoscape Items we want to implement someday:

cPath Functionality Issues:
----------------------------
1.  Field Specific Searching, e.g. "name:RAS".
2.  Indexing of interactions
3.  Build a Front-end interface to the External Database Tables
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
4.  Create cPath Developer Docs
5.  Add new query:  query by experimental method (e.g. all the data from two-hybrid)
6.  Gary's latest idea:  re:  loading external references.
7.  Provide query API functionality to get a list of valid query API commands.  E.g. for getInteractionsBySource,
	we could have getValidSources
8.  Add getExternalReferences to query API.  This would allow e.g. Cytoscape to easily create external links.
9.  For HTML front end of cPath query API: paginate results
10. Issue of large result sets returned from query API.  One possible solution is to write a getQuerySize query, which
    takes as input another query and returns the result size.  If there is a performance issue, queries can be precomputed.

cPath Performance/Reliability/Security Issues
---------------------------------------------
1.  Add support for Tomcat JDBC Connection Pooling. [done]
2.  Load Testing via JMeter.
3.  Prevent against cross-scripting vulnerability.
4.  Set up auto-emails upon fatal cPath errors.

Data Service Specific Items:
-----------------------------
1.  Add an Ontology object to the dataservices bio package.
2.  Add Gene Name/Synonym Look up to data services.
3.  Create a service for reading in Cytoscape node/edge attributes.
4.  Create an "About Data Services PlugIn", with version #, list of all registered
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
5.  Resurrect the GRID Plugin
6.  Revise API from client perspective
