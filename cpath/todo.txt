This document contains cPath/Cytoscape Items we want to implement someday:

cPath Functionality Issues:
----------------------------
1.  Field Specific Lucene Searching, e.g. "name:RAS". 
	---> current priority:  low.
2.  Indexing of interactions.
	Requires changes to web interface.  Needs more exploration.
	---> current priority:  low.
3.  Build a Front-end administrative interface to the External Database Tables
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
4.  Add new query:  query by experimental method (e.g. all the data from two-hybrid)
	---> current priority:  ???.
5.  Provide query API functionality to get a list of valid query API commands.  
	E.g. for getInteractionsBySource, we could have getValidSources
	---> current priority:  low.
6.  Add getExternalReferences to query API.  This would allow e.g. Cytoscape 
	to easily create external links.
	---> current priority:  medium.
7.  For HTML front end of cPath query API: paginate results (only text index results currently paginated)
	---> current priority:  low.
8.  Support content-length calculation of PSI-MI queries, where possible, to support more accurate progress metering on the client side.  We might be able to easily do it for queries that are cached and for the precomputed queries.  For queries that aren't, we could at least provide updates of the parsing progress as it happens (Rob's idea)
	---> Current priority: low.

cPath Performance/Reliability/Security Issues
---------------------------------------------
1.  Prevent against cross-scripting vulnerability (validate user input before use).
2.  Set up auto-emails upon fatal cPath errors (how does a user deal with errors?).

Data Service Specific Items:
-----------------------------
1.  Add an Ontology object to the dataservices bio package to allow retrieval of Gene Ontology type information.
2.  Add Gene Name/Synonym Look up to data services (requires a back-end, may be able to use Entrez Gene DB).
3.  Create a service for reading in Cytoscape node/edge attributes to go with sif reader.
4.  Create an "About Data Services PlugIn", with version #, list of all registered
	(more details are included in phase 6 doc, before being deferred)
	---> current priority:  low.
5.  Resurrect the GRID Plugin - retrieves data from GRID directly into Cytoscape
