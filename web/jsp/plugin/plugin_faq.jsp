<h2><FONT FACE="ARIAL">What is cPath?</FONT></h2>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">
cPath is a web-based database of protein-protein interactions.  Using cPath,
a researcher can search for specific protein-protein interaction records,
inspect matching records, and export them to a third-party database or
visualization application.
<P>
Currently, cPath only provides support for protein-protein interaction
records, but we plan to add support for metabolic pathways and signal
transduction pathways in the near future.  The long term goal of cPath is
to provide a public repository of cancer specific pathways, and make it
freely available to the scientific community.
<P>
cPath is currently being developed by the Sander group at the
Computational Biology Center
of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

<h2><FONT FACE="ARIAL">
What kind of data is currently available via cPath?</FONT></h2>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">
cPath aggregates protein-protein interaction records
from a number of public repositories, e.g.
BIND, MINT and Intact.

<h2><FONT FACE="ARIAL">What are the near term / long term goals for cPath?
</FONT></h2>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">
In the near-term, we plan to add support for metabolic pathways, and signal
transduction pathways.  We are also exploring options for manual curation
of cancer specific pathways.
