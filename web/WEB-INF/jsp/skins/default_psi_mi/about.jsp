<h1>About cPath</h1>
<p>cPath is a database and software suite for storing, visualizing, and analyzing biological pathways.
</p>

<p>Main features:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Import pipeline capable of aggregrating pathway and interaction data sets from multiple
    sources, including:  MINT, IntAct,  HPRD, DIP, BioCyc, KEGG, PUMA2 and
    Reactome.</li>
    <li>Import/Export support for the Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interaction
    (<a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net/mi/xml/doc/user/">PSI-MI</a>) and
    the Biological Pathways Exchange (<a href="http://www.biopax.org">BioPAX</a>) XML formats.</li>
    <li>Data visualization and analysis via <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a>.</li>
    <li>Simple HTTP URL based XML web service.</li>
    <li>Complete software is <a href="http://cbio.mskcc.org/dev_site/cpath/">freely available for local
    install</a>.  Easy to install and administer.</li>
    <li>Partly funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, via the Cancer Biomedical
    Informatics Grid (<a href="https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/">caBIG</a>), and
    aims to meet "silver-level" requirements for software interoperability
    and data exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>cPath is currently being developed by the <a href="http://cbio.mskcc.org">Computational
Biology Center</a> at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</a>.</p>

<h1>About cBio @ MSKCC</h1>
<p>The Computational Biology Center at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (<a href="http://www.mskcc.org">MSKCC</a>)
pursues computational biology research projects and the development of
bioinformatics resources in the areas of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>sequence-structure analysis</li>
    <li>gene regulation</li>
    <li>molecular pathways and networks</li>
    <li>diagnostic and prognostic indicators</li>
</ul>

<p>The mission of cBio is to
move the theoretical methods and genome-scale data resources of
computational biology into everyday laboratory practice and use, and is
reflected in the organization of cBio into research and service
components -- the intention being that new computational methods
created through the process of scientific inquiry should be generalized
and supported as open-source and shared community resources.</p>
