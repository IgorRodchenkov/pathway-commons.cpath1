<h2>About Pathway Commons</h2>
<p>Pathway Commons is a convenient point of access to biological pathway information
collected from public pathway databases, which you can browse or search.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Biologists</b> can browse and search Pathway Commons pathways.</li>
    <li><b>Computational biologists</b> can download all pathways in BioPAX format for global analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Software developers</b> can build software on top of Pathway Commons using
        our <a href='webservice.do?cmd=help'>web service API</a>. You can also download and install
        the <a href="http://cbio.mskcc.org/dev_site/cpath/">cPath software</a> to create a
        local mirror of Pathway Commons.

<h2>About cBio @ MSKCC</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://cbio.mskcc.org">Computational Biology Center</a> at
<a href="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</a>
pursues computational biology research projects and the development of bioinformatics
resources in the areas of:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> sequence-structure analysis </li>
   <li> gene regulation </li>
   <li> molecular pathways and networks </li>
   <li> diagnostic and prognostic indicators </li>
</ul>
<p>
The mission of cBio is to move the theoretical methods and genome-scale data resources of
computational biology into everyday laboratory practice and use, and is reflected in the
organization of cBio into research and service components -- the intention being that
new computational methods created through the process of scientific inquiry should be
generalized and supported as open-source and shared community resources.
